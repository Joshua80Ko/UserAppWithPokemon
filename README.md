# UserAppWithPokemon

Welcome to my first React app! This app is gathering user data. To register Click the 'Register User' menu on the left panel. There are 4 steps to submit user information.

Step 1: User Form
Step 2: Select Pokemon
Step 3: Review
Step 4: Submitted
It's saving the user data to the browser local storage. So If a user refreshed the page, the user would still see their input. (Saving to Database has not been implemented yet.)

Pokemon can be selected by type of Pokemon. The images were downloaded from external source by pokemon Id.

User can go back to any previous step but not next step without action such as clicking save.
